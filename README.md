# REFACTOR-MERN-BOOKS

## Description

This project was a refactoring assignment to convert an outdated RESTful API to use a GraphQL API to create a user profile that saves, deletes, and updates a reading list. Updates to the existing pages, and adding new mutations, queries, typeDefinitions, and resolvers was challenging. I developed my problem solving and version control skills to try to get the best solution.
